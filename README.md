# üëã Hi, I'm Kyle!

## üöÄ About Me

I'm a versatile Software Engineer, passionate problem solver, and lifelong learner. With a unique background spanning military intelligence, fast paced tech startups, and enterprise engineering, I thrive on tackling complex challenges and delivering effective, scalable solutions.

I began my career in the U.S. Air Force as an Intelligence Analyst, where I discovered my love for automation and optimization, reducing hours long report formatting to a single click with custom Microsoft Word macros. Since then I've followed my passion for code, always seeking the next opportunity to streamline workflows and drive innovation across diverse teams and technologies.
